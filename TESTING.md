### Bugs and fixes
- Bug:
Had an issue with **Materialize sidenav overlay**. When you open the sidenav, content is barely visible.

- Fix:
Did a research on how to deal with this issue and found solution on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38642911/how-to-disable-sidenav-overlay-in-materializecss */).
The set the height and width of the overlay to **0**.

- Bug:
Issue with Event Listener when trying to check if passwords match. 
As I added same Event Listener to multiple elements and had a conflict on other pages.

![JS Error](assets/img-readme/js-error.png)
    
        [password, confirmPassword].addEventListener('click', checkIfPasswordsMatch)

- Fix:
Add onclick event in HTML to the elements and remove the Event Listener. Also probably could have targeted the elements by their id rather than class, and kept the Event Listener.
